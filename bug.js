This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera configurations.  The issue manifests when attempting to access camera features like zoom or focus after initially setting the camera type (front or back).  Accessing these features results in an error or unexpected behavior, such as the feature not responding or throwing an exception. The behavior is inconsistent, sometimes working and sometimes failing, seemingly randomly.
